main.py:
This script handles the entire processing workflow and utilizes the complete dataset. Due to the large volume of data being processed, it requires a significant amount of time to execute and substantial RAM resources.

test.py:
This script processes only a small subset of the data, such as the first 100 records or a random sample of 1%. It demonstrates that our model outperforms BM25 using this limited dataset.

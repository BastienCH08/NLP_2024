# TripAdvisor Recommendation Challenge


This project aims to build a robust semantic ranking model for TripAdvisor reviews using advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. By applying Sentence Transformers (specifically the all-mpnet-base-v2 model), the goal is to outperform the traditional BM25 algorithm in generating contextually relevant recommendations based on user reviews.

## Project Overview

The project utilizes the Kaggle TripAdvisor review dataset to build a ranking system that captures deeper contextual meanings through embedding generation and similarity computation. The performance of this semantic ranking model is evaluated by comparing it against the BM25 algorithm, with the Mean Squared Error (MSE) used to quantify the differences between their rankings.
